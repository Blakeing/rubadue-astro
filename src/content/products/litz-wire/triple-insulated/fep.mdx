overview: "Litz wire is made of several strands of enameled magnet wire that are bunched or stranded together. It is used where losses caused by the skin-and proximity effect on a single wire are too high due to the operating frequency. At the same time the operating temperature isr educed by its use. Litz wire has much greater mechanical flexibility than a single wire with the same cross-section."

  - "High frequency applications"
  - "Switch Mode Power Supplies"
