When designing or selecting a Litz wire for use in a winding, it is important to understand and minimize skin effect and proximity effect losses wherever it is possible to do so. The uneven distribution of current in a Litz wire conductor, due to skin effect and proximity effect losses, increases the overall resistance in an AC circuit. The purpose of this article is to briefly explain skin effect and proximity effect losses and what can be done to minimize them.

## Understanding the Effects

Skin effect is the tendency for current in an AC circuit to flow primarily on the outer edge of a conductor. Proximity effect is the tendency for current to flow in other undesirable patterns, such as loops or concentrated distributions, due to the presence of magnetic fields generated by nearby conductors.

Both skin effect and proximity effect losses can be further broken down into losses occurring at:
- The strand level
- The bundle level

## Minimizing Skin Effect Losses

With proper Litz wire design, it is possible to minimize both types of skin effect losses:

### Strand Level
Strand level skin effect losses can be minimized by selecting an individual strand size whose diameter is smaller than two times the skin depth at the operating frequency, or the effective frequency in the case of non-sinusoidal currents.

The skin depth (δ) can be calculated using:

\[δ = \sqrt{\frac{ρ}{πfμ_0}}\]

Where:
- δ = Skin Depth (m)
- f = frequency (Hz)
- ρ = Resistivity of conductor material (Ω⋅m)
- μ₀ = permeability of free space (4×10⁻⁷π H/m)

### Bundle Level
Bundle-level skin-effect losses become significant when the diameter of the overall Litz conductor is greater than two times the skin depth. When that is the case, bundle-level skin effect losses can be minimized by breaking the Litz conductor up into smaller bundles and twisting those smaller bundles together in specific arrangements.

To determine if it is necessary to break a Litz conductor up into smaller bundles, calculate the maximum number of strands that should be bunched in a single operation (n₁,max):

\[n_{1,max} = \frac{8δ^2}{d_s^2}\]

Where:
- ds = Diameter of an individual strand (m)

## Optimal Bundling Configurations

When the number of strands in the Litz conductor exceeds n₁,max, the conductor should be broken up into smaller bundles. Follow these guidelines:

1. Stranding operations after the initial bunching step should utilize groups of 3, 4, or 5 bundles or sub-bundles
2. These groupings ensure no bundle or sub-bundle ends up in the center of the overall conductor or in a larger bundle

### Note on 6 or 7 Bundle Configurations

While configurations with 6 or 7 bundles are common in older Litz products, they are not optimal for electrical performance:

- A group of 6 bundles with nothing in the center is mechanically unstable and will eventually collapse
- A group of 7 bundles naturally places one bundle in the center, leading to uneven current distribution
- While inert fillers can be used in the center, this increases cost and complication in termination

## Minimizing Proximity Effect Losses

Proximity effect losses can be minimized through appropriate lay length selection for the overall Litz conductor. The optimal approach depends on the winding length:

### For Many Turns (n>6)
- Strand-level proximity effect losses typically dominate
- Longer lay lengths may be advantageous
- Tighter lay lengths can increase strand-level skin effect losses and twist loss

### For Few Turns (n≤6)
- Proximity effect losses can dominate if the lay length is not short relative to winding length
- Shorter lay lengths can help minimize bundle-level proximity effect losses

## Conclusion

Optimal Litz wire performance requires careful design consideration to minimize skin and proximity effect losses. This can be achieved by:

1. Limiting the number of strands bunched in a single operation
2. Using groups of 3, 4, or 5 bundles for multiple-operation stranding
3. Selecting appropriate lay length based on winding length
4. Avoiding configurations that place bundles in the center of the conductor
