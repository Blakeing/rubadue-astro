### SEO Best Practices

#### Title Optimization
- Keep titles under 60 characters
- Include primary keywords naturally
- Make titles descriptive and compelling
- Examples:
  - Good: "Wire Insulation Temperature Ratings: A Complete Guide"
  - Avoid: "Insulation Guide" or "Everything You Need to Know About Wire Temperature Ratings and How to Select the Right Material"

#### Description Guidelines
- 120-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Write compelling copy that encourages clicks
- Summarize the main value proposition

#### Tag Strategy
- Use 3-7 relevant tags per article
- Include:
  - Content type (e.g., "Technical Guide", "Application Note")
  - Primary topic (e.g., "Insulation", "Litz Wire")
  - Industry/application (e.g., "Automotive", "Medical")
  - Technical specs when relevant (e.g., "High Temperature")

### Markdown Guidelines

#### Tables
Use tables for technical specifications and comparisons:

```markdown
| Material | Temperature Rating | Voltage Rating | Applications |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| FEP      | 155째C            | 600V          | Telecom     |
| PFA      | 180째C            | 1000V         | Medical     |
```

#### Lists
- Use bullet points for features and benefits
- Use numbered lists for procedures and steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure

#### Links
- Link to relevant products when mentioned
- Link to related knowledge base articles
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
- Example: `[PFA insulated wire products](/catalog/single-insulated/pfa/)`

#### Code Blocks
Use code blocks for:
- Technical specifications
- Formula examples
- Configuration examples

```
Specification: AWG 24 (7/32)
Insulation: 0.002" FEP
Temperature Rating: 155째C
```

## Product Content
